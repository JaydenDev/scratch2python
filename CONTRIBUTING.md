## Coding Style

Use `mixedCase` for most names. For class names, use `CamelCase`.
Always use DOUBLE QUOTES (like ")!

## Methods

Please look for methods instead of writing it again. If it may be done many times, create a method.

## GNU/Linux

Scratch2Python is developed on GNU/Linux. While Windows support is important, Linux is too. Don't do anything that dosen't work on GNU/Linux.
